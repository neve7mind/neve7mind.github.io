Not only does it allow you to create beautifully designed documents, but it also allows users to implement very quickly such complex elements of a printed set as mathematical expressions, tables, links and bibliographies, getting a consistent layout across all sections.\nWith the availability of a large number of open libraries (a little bit later), LaTEX’s capabilities are almost limitless. These libraries empower users even more by allowing you to add footnotes, draw diagrams, etc.\nOne of the most compelling reasons many people use LaTeX is to separate the content of a document from its style. This means that after writing the content, you can easily change its appearance. Similarly, one document style can be created and used to standardize the appearance of others.\nThis allows scientific journals to create templates for the proposed materials. Such templates have a given markup, leaving only the content to be added. In fact, there are hundreds of such templates, from various resumes to slide presentations.\nJulia programming language The Julia language is a cross-platform compiled, freely distributed programming language (MIT license) with dynamic typing, which has a number of advantages and disadvantages. The B Julia is a JIT-based compilation. The Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation allows both expressiveness of modern interpreted languages and performance of languages such as C and Fortran. The JIT compiler performs the compilation during the first run of the program, extracting from the text information not explicitly specified by the programmer, and using this information to optimize the generated machine code.\nThe advantages of the Julia language include the following:\nSimplicity is an intuitive language whose syntax resembles that of Python and MATLAB; the performance of programs written in Julia is comparable to that of programs written in C or Fortran; effective vectoring and parallelization of calculations, a large number of data types, including rational and complex numbers; calculation in the absence of some data (there is a type given missing); calculation precision setting (BigFloat data type, setprecision function); the implementation of symbolic calculations using macro commands; using libraries written in C and Fortran, and sharing libraries with Python and R; integration with DBMS (PostgreSQL, MySQL, JSON). ; support for Unicode characters; the use of the multiple dispatch paradigm - the call of the function depends little on the type of parameters of the function (parametric polymorphism); a good built-in mathematical library with linear algebra functions. Julia is a full programming language that has integer arithmetic, floating point operations, cycles, C-like structures, and even a goto operator analogue. However, in the language there is a very convenient possibility of vectoring calculations, which is characteristic of high-level languages.\nIf we talk about the shortcomings of the Julia language, it should be noted that the compilation time of large programs can be quite noticeable (minutes); is a relatively new language, so the number of libraries in this language is relatively small ( compared to Python ); cannot create separately tested program - Julia programs work only in Julia environment. Octave programming language MGNU Octave is a free system for mathematical computing[1] that uses a high-level MATLAB compatible language.\nOctave introduces an interactive command interface to solve linear and nonlinear mathematical problems, as well as other numerical experiments. In addition, Octave can be used for batch processing. Octave uses arithmetic of real and complex scalars, vectors and matrices, has extensions for solving linear algebraic problems, finding the roots of systems of nonlinear algebraic equations, working with polynomials, solving various differential equations, integration of systems of differential and differential algebraic equations of the first order, integration of functions on finite and infinite intervals. This list can be easily expanded using the Octave language (or using dynamically downloadable modules created in C, C++, Fortran, etc.).\nResearchers at the University of Maryland in the United States performed comparative analysis of mathematical computing using MATLAB, Octave, SciLab and FreeMat in a simple and complex scenario. In the first case the system of linear equations was solved and in the second - the finite-differential discretization of the Poisson equation in two-dimensional space.

Превью проекта В данном проекте мной был создан односвязный список, каждый узел которого хранит в себе данные определённого человека: имя, рост и вес. Само собой был реализован набор функций, указанных в цели проекта.\nВесь проект можно будет лицезреть в самое ближайшее время ЗДЕСЬ.\nКак же всё-таки мне это удалось? Объявляем структуру узла, содержащую в себе 3 поля (string, int, double) и ссылку на следующий элемент. struct Human { string name; int growth; double weight; Human* next; }; Реализуем функцию добавления элемента в начало списка. Передаём ссылку на указатель первого элемента и поля нашей структуры (далее «базовые параметры»). Создаём новый объект типа Human, его адрес присваиваем переменной (newNode) Далее “кладём” в функцию базовые параметры, передаваемые в функции. Устанавливаем ссылку нового узла на ‘голову’ списка (pNode) и устанавливаем новый узел как ‘голову’ списка. void AddFirst(Human* \u0026amp;pNode, string name, int growth, double weight) { Human* newNode = new Human; newNode-\u0026gt;name = name; newNode-\u0026gt;growth = growth; newNode-\u0026gt;weight = weight; newNode-\u0026gt;next = pNode; pNode=newNode; } Реализуем функцию добавления элемента в конец списка. Передаём ссылку на указатель первого элемента и базовые параметры. Создаём новый объект типа Human, его адрес присваиваем переменной (newNode). Далее “кладём” в функцию базовые параметры и устанавливаем ссылку нового узла на ‘голову’ списка (pNode). Если у нас пустой список, то по сути мы создаём 1ый элемент. Else мы ищем последний элемент, после чего кладем в tmp адрес последнего элемента списка. void AddLast(Human* \u0026amp;pNode, string name, int growth, double weight) { Human* newNode = new Human; newNode-\u0026gt;name = name; newNode-\u0026gt;growth = growth; newNode-\u0026gt;weight = weight; newNode-\u0026gt;next = pNode; if (pNode == nullptr) { newNode-\u0026gt;next = nullptr; pNode = newNode; } else { Human* tmp = pNode; while (tmp-\u0026gt;next != nullptr) tmp = tmp-\u0026gt;next; newNode-\u0026gt;next = nullptr; tmp-\u0026gt;next=newNode; } } Реализуем функцию добавления элемента после заданного. Передаём указатель на первый элемент для создания копии внешнего объекта (pNode), строку, по которой будет происходить поиск узла и базовые параметры. Если у нас пустой список, то выводим сообщение об этом. Ищем нужный нам элемент, т.е. устанавливаем начало списка и движемся по списку. Если дошли до последнего элемента и не нашли нужный, выводим соответствующее сообщение. void AddAfter (Human* pNode, string Node, string name, int growth, double weight) { if (pNode == nullptr) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;This list is empty\\n\u0026#34;; return; } Human* tmp = pNode; while (tmp-\u0026gt;next != nullptr and tmp-\u0026gt;name != Node) tmp = tmp-\u0026gt;next; if (tmp-\u0026gt;next == nullptr and tmp-\u0026gt;name != Node) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;No element in the list\\n\u0026#34;; return; } Human* newNode = new Human; newNode-\u0026gt;name = name; newNode-\u0026gt;growth = growth; newNode-\u0026gt;weight = weight; newNode-\u0026gt;next = pNode-\u0026gt;next; pNode-\u0026gt;next = newNode; } Реализуем функцию добавления элемента перед заданным. Передаём указатель на первый элемент для создания копии внешнего объекта (pNode), строку, по которой будет происходить поиск узла и базовые параметры. Если у нас пустой список, то выводим сообщение об этом. Если первый же элемент является искомым, то вызываем функцию AddFirst. Создаём переменные, хранящие ссылки на предыдущий (prev) и последующий (tmp) элементы. Далее цикл для поиска нужного узла (Node). Если дошли до последнего элемента и не нашли нужный, выводим соответствующее сообщение. Если нашли, выполняем стандартные действия, заполняя новый узел и устанавливаем поле next на tmp, а поле next у prev устанавливаем на новый созданный узел. void AddBefore(Human* pNode, string Node, string name, int growth, double weight) { if (pNode == nullptr) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;This list is empty\\n\u0026#34;; return; } if (pNode-\u0026gt;name == Node) { AddFirst(pNode, name, growth, weight); return; } Human *prev = pNode, *tmp = pNode-\u0026gt;next; while (tmp-\u0026gt;next != nullptr and tmp-\u0026gt;name != Node) { tmp = tmp-\u0026gt;next; prev = prev-\u0026gt;next; } if (tmp-\u0026gt;next == nullptr and tmp-\u0026gt;name != Node) { cout \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#34;No element in the list\\n\u0026#34;; return; } Human* newNode = new Human; newNode-\u0026gt;name = name; newNode-\u0026gt;growth = growth; newNode-\u0026gt;weight = weight; newNode-\u0026gt;next = tmp; prev-\u0026gt;next = newNode; } Реализуем функцию удаления узла по имени (name).

Пожалуй, это временное ощущение и да, через пару дней, а может быть, даже часов это чувство снова накроется толстым беспросветным слоем рутины, которая всеобъемлюще пожирает то, что раньше было принято называть жизнью.\nПочему мы так не ценим то время, которое нам отведено? Ту, единственную для всех нас песчинку, во время которой мы можем дышать, любить и умирать за любовь. Пожалуй, сегодня время - это единственная форма материи, заставляющая человека обернуться назад и спросить себя - себя тогдашнего, не угнетаемого мелочами, не поглощённого бессмысленностью: “А так ли я представлял себе свою жизнь?”. Наверняка большинство задавшихся впервые этим вопросом с громкой уверенностью ответят: “Что? Так ли я представлял свою жизнь? Что за вздор!.. Конечно, так. Как же иначе? А что, кто-то думает, что я недоволен своей жизнью, что я несчастлив?”. Но звенящая тишина пустых комнат даст более точный ответ, и встреча с этим ответом будет неизбежна, подобно тому, как неукоснительно упал взор Гая Монтэга на вентиляционную решётку, где хранились ответы на все все вопросы, когда-либо заданные.\nТак рассуждал, потягивая сигарету, молодой студент второго курса престижного столичного университета со странноватым названием “Технический университет имени Фредерика Тэйлора”, ну или как его называли сами студенты - ТУФТа. Частенько Николай, убегая от так надоевших ему математики и программирования, погружался в подобные рассуждения, коротая одинокие ночи. И эта ночь не стала исключением.

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book, you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.\nLocal Version Control Systems Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.\nTo deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.\nCentralized Version Control Systems The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.\nThis setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.\nHowever, this setup also has some serious downsides. The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents. If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines. Local VCSs suffer from this same problem — whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.\nDistributed Version Control Systems This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.\nFurthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project. This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.\n","date":1710460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710460800,"objectID":"58d7550e5042cd731e56ca255aaf453a","permalink":"https://example.com/post/post2_git/","publishdate":"2024-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post2_git/","section":"post","summary":"In this post I will talk about the git version control system.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Git version control","type":"post"},{"authors":["Murashov I.V."],"categories":["Demo"],"content":"Monday is a hard day I’ve been visiting my parents since Saturday. Joined an online lecture, but instead of going to bed like every good student would, he took the initiative at the top and presented a report on operating system processes.\nIn the afternoon I returned to Moscow. More suburban train I hate only 2 commuter trains. The smell of phantom feces, wherever they sit, the provincials arguing about what beers they will open after the next stop, the great relocation of hares to neighboring carriages when conductors, aggressive grannies, privatized 2 rows and praising the authoritarian regime, established in the country (during the time of Stalin, of course). In order to somehow endure such manifestations of the aforementioned mass, I put on headphones and it saves… But not for long: every 2 stations at the beginning of the car begin to appear county commentators with loudspeakers, from which, the eardrums burst like balloons launched at the Kremlin, and ears twisted into a tube. They seem to have everything: a raincoat, a towel, swimming trunks, a welding machine, ice cream, headphones, a Makarov pistol and contraceptives (I think the most necessary for the carriage contingent) - as they say, everything - from a loaf to a condom, and all of a hundred rubles. I think the only thing they don’t have is another salesman.\nAfter an hour on the train and half an hour on the bus, I find myself at home, where I translate my spirit and sit down to do my homework.\nTuesday and Wednesday are hard days The night before, having decided to make a difference in my life, I got up at 6:00 in the morning, sleeping the most five hours in the last week. With closed eyes he made coffee and a lab. I went to volleyball and in the evening I met my brother in the craft - a friend-masochist programmer. Overnight we wrote in Java. After a 1.5-hour sleep, he came to the university, where he died two couples in a row. Having failed, he went home to sleep, but since there is a lot of work, and in a day of only 24 hours (which genius came up with this!?), the day’s sleep made up a couple of hours, after which I did my hw.\nThursday is a hard day either I went to couples, after which I taught mathematics to my sadistic student. Briefly about him: this creature is not deprived of a sense of humor, and therefore for two hours I was a boiling kettle with red eyes (from lack of sleep!). Yes, yes, I had to edit all the puzzles in which the answer resembled at least the number 300. You just can’t imagine how much excitement this beautiful creature has had every time it’s reminded me that killing is worth eight to 20 years, because that’s the only thing that’s kept me sitting in place since these stupid theses like ‘2 {0.5} = 1’, “You can’t hit kids” and all that crap.\nHaving heroically gone through these trials, I went to bed exhausted.\nFriday - so we survived Extremely happy, since I realize that the work week has ended and the working weekend has begun.\nConclusions I repent, I am sinful. I could have done much more if I had planned my time correctly and restored the regime. But in order to do that, we have to do all the labs, and in order to do all the labs, we have to find time for them, and in order to do them, we have to do all the labs, we have to…\nI wish everyone peace and goodness.\n","date":1710460800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1710460800,"objectID":"d9a0b62a8071532953c37580186ec0e6","permalink":"https://example.com/post/post1_last-week/","publishdate":"2024-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/post1_last-week/","section":"post","summary":"So I’m going to tell you what I’ve been doing this week, and I’m going to analyze it.","tags":["Academic"],"title":"How was my week?","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!
